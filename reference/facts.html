<div class="box-title">Levels</div>
<div class="paragraph">
There are 8 basic levels in the game. Each set of 8 has
an increasing level of difficulty set in the game logic
<table class="map">
<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1 -  8</td>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ducklings</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">9 - 16</td>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Mother duck</td>

<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">17 - 24</td>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ducklings and mother duck</td>

<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">25 - 32</td>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Double ducklings and mother duck</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">33 - 40</td>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Fast double ducklings and mother duck</td>
</tr>
</table>
After this, level 41 is the same as level 33, and so on ad infinitum,
except with the time gradually being reduced to 400 at level 65.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The game display showing the current level at <a href="../asm/44700.html#44738">AEC2</a> can only accommodate two
digits, but the internal counter at <a href="../asm/28395.html">6EEB</a> is an 8-bit unsigned number. Therefore,
after level 99, the counter overflows to 0, but play can continue as it if were 100,
wrapping round again to 200 and progressing to level 255 (displayed as "55"). After
this, level 0 is on the full difficulty level, then the level counter finally overflows
to 1 and difficulty drops to the easiest.
Unlike Pac-Man, there is no other related bug so play can continue until the heat death of
the universe....

<div><span id="mother_duck"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Mother duck</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The mother duck is in play on every level, but its updated location
in the routine at <a href="../asm/41160.html">A0C8</a> is ignored on levels below 9. The player
will still lose a life if they walk into her.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="character_name"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Character name</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The game's protagonist is assumed to be called "Henhouse Harry"
after Chuckie Egg II. However, no name is stored anywhere in
the original.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="theme_tunes"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Theme tunes</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The tune at the start of the game is "The Birdie Song" which was
a top five hit a few years before the game was released. It is
one of the most annoying and infuriating tunes of all time,
with the possible exception of Mr Blobby.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The tune played when the player loses a life is a brief extract
of the traditional Spanish guitar piece "Romance Anonimo".
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="speech"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Speech</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The game supports the Fuller Orator, a hardware extension to the Fuller Box
audio box with a dedicated speech module. The routine for this is at <a href="../asm/40130.html">9CC2</a>.
